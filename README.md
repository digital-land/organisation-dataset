A dataset of Local Planning Authorities and other organisations who publish data used by Digital Land:

* [collection/organisation.csv](collection/organisation.csv)

The list of organisations is assembled from the following registers:

* [government-organisation](https://government-organisation.register.gov.uk)
* [local-authority-eng](https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

and combined with the following registers to provide statistical geographies:

* [statistical-geography-county-eng](https://statistical-geography-county-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-london-borough-eng](https://statistical-geography-london-borough-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng](https://statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

The data is matched against [https://opendatacommunities.org](https://opendatacommunities.org/home).

This locally maintained dataset provides websites for local authorities, development corporations not yet listed on GOV.UK, and other missing values:

* [data/organisations.csv](data/organisations.csv)

The plan is to move to replace this locally maintained data with the website, and other data sourced from Wikipedia, such as https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q931180

# Updating the dataset

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:
