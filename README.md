A data package of Local Planning Authorities and other organisations who publish data used by Digital Land:

* [collection/organisation.csv](collection/organisation.csv)

This file is used by the pipeline process, but will be soon replaced by data managed in registers by the data standards team.

* [government-organisation](https://government-organisation.register.gov.uk)
* [local-authority-eng](https://local-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

and combined with the following registers to provide statistical geographies:

* [statistical-geography-county-eng](https://statistical-geography-county-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-london-borough-eng](https://statistical-geography-london-borough-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng](https://statistical-geography-non-metropolitan-district-eng.register.gov.uk)
* [statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng](https://statistical-geography-unitary-authority-eng.register.gov.uk)

The data was matched against [https://opendatacommunities.org](https://opendatacommunities.org/home),
